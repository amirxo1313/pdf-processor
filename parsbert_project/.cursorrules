# CRITICAL RULES FOR CURSOR AI - STRICT ENFORCEMENT

## ZERO HALLUCINATION POLICY
- Every piece of data MUST come from actual PDF source
- NO fabricated entities, dates, or legal terms
- If information doesn't exist, leave field empty or null
- NEVER generate example/placeholder content

## ACCURACY REQUIREMENTS
- Text extraction accuracy: 100% (no summarization)
- Entity extraction: Only ACTUAL entities found in text
- Farsi normalization: Lossless (preserve all characters)
- Paragraph splitting: Respect sentence boundaries exactly

## FORBIDDEN ACTIONS
- ❌ Creating fake legal terms that don't exist in source
- ❌ Adding placeholder dates like "1400/01/01"
- ❌ Inventing document titles when not present
- ❌ Truncating text to fit arbitrary limits
- ❌ Using Python libraries for entity extraction (AI must do it)
- ❌ Generating "sample" or "example" JSON outputs
- ❌ Approximating numbers or dates

## MANDATORY VALIDATIONS
- ✅ Compare output char count with input (must be ≥95%)
- ✅ Verify every entity exists in source text
- ✅ Check integrity_score reflects ACTUAL quality
- ✅ Ensure no lorem ipsum or dummy data anywhere

## ERROR HANDLING
- Corrupted PDF → Log as "EXTRACTION_FAILED" (don't guess)
- Scanned image PDF → Log as "OCR_REQUIRED" (don't fake text)
- Empty PDF → Log as "NO_CONTENT" (don't fill with examples)
- Password protected → Log as "ACCESS_DENIED" (don't bypass)

## CODE STYLE
- All comments in Persian
- All error messages in Persian
- Type hints on every function
- No hardcoded strings (use config)
- UTF-8 encoding everywhere
